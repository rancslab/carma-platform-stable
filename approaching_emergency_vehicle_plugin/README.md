# approaching_emergency_vehicle_plugin

The Approaching Emergency Vehicle Plugin is a ROS2 node and is one of the strategic plugins in the CARMA System. The plugin is responsible for processing incoming BSMs to determine whether a nearby active emergency resonse vehicle (ERV) exists, and for generating maneuvers that account for an approaching (i.e. will eventually pass the ego vehicle on the same stretch of road) ERV.
